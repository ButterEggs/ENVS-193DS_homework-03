### Problem 1. Personal data
[I could calculate the mean number of steps I took on school days versus non-school days to compare how my physical activity differs depending on whether I have class. This would be informative because on school days I often walk between classes, while on non-school days I tend to be working at my job which requires constant movement for a few hours, so I expect to have more steps on those days.]
